# Project: Implementation of Mux-Based Logic using Verilog

## Description

This project focuses on the implementation of multiplexer (mux) based logic circuits using Verilog hardware description language. A multiplexer, commonly referred to as a "mux," is a fundamental digital logic component that selects one of several inputs and directs it to the output based on control signals. The project provides a hands-on introduction to designing and simulating mux-based logic circuits using Verilog.


## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to implement and simulate mux-based logic circuits using Verilog. The project includes the following components:

- **MUX Implementation**: We will design and implement various muxes with different numbers of inputs (2:1, 4:1, etc.).
- **Logic Circuits**: Using these muxes, we will create more complex logic circuits, such as multiplexer-based adders and multiplexer-based flip-flops.
- **Simulation**: We will simulate the designed circuits using Verilog simulation tools to verify their functionality.
- **Documentation**: This README serves as a guide to understanding the project, its components, and how to replicate and expand upon the work.
